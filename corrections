TA Corrections 
In your operator<<, you correctly print the first element to os, but for the rest of the sequence it goes to cout
You added setters for the node class, which is fine, the issue is you have them return the value of the next/prev node. Since next/prev are pointers they could be nullptr, so returning the value can cause a seg fault. Technically setters don't need to return anything.
In erase, you're actually allocating more memory by using new with all the local pointer variables. 
Also, erase won't delete the last node. When you check current->next != nullptr, for the last node that is true, so current doesn't get deleted.
You have a memory leak in the destructor, the order you delete current and set it to nullptr is reversed. Otherwise it works!
